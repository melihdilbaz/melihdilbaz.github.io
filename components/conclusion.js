        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            To provide a statistical foundation for hypothesis testing, the dataset (<strong>final_categorized_merged.csv</strong>) was refined, transitioning from monthly-based to semester-based data. Two lists of data were formed:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Monthly discretionary rates</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Semester-based discretionary rates</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The relation between data points in both charts below is approximately linear, allowing the use of the Pearson correlation coefficient, which evaluates linear relationships:

        <img src="./images/concImg2.png" alt="Semester-Based Discretionary Rates" class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-1/2 h-auto mb-4">
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Findings:</strong>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700">
            <li>The first chart (monthly discretionary rates) shows a weak linear relationship.</li>
            <li>The second chart (semester-based rates) has fewer data points but still suggests a linear relation.</li>
            <li>In both cases, total spending over the time period does not significantly influence the discretionary share attribute.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The Pearson test results are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Monthly Spending:</strong>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
                <li>Correlation coefficient: <strong>0.1174261645459552</strong></li>
                <li>P-value: <strong>0.6122084602151447</strong></li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Semester Spending:</strong>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
                <li>Correlation coefficient: <strong>-0.5689070256803843</strong></li>
                <li>P-value: <strong>0.31687742685132503</strong></li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Both p-values exceed the significance level of 0.05, which prevents rejecting the Null Hypothesis. This indicates that there is no statistically significant evidence to support the claim of the alternative hypothesis.

            As a student at SabancÄ± University, in high-inflation conditions, there is no significant shift in my spending habits from discretionary to essential categories.
